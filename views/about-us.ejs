          <h1>Our commitment</h1>
          <p>We're built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good
              along the way. We want to make it easy for you to dicover and brew the world's
              best coffee at home. It all starts at the source. To locate the specific lots
              we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the
              challenges and opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate with exceptional
              coffee growers and empower a global community of farmers through with well above fair-trade
              benchmarks. We also offer training, support farm community initiatives, and invest in coffee
              plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting
              profiles distinctive to their native growing region.

            Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest
            and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid
            over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a
            roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee,
            so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.
